                This ball of goo is a fun, inexpensive project to make with kids.
                It's a great way to experiment with the basic ingredients.
                This is the first in our new series of educational toys, new science experiments.
                In this product, we look at a new technique for making a goo that is a
                little bit like Jell-o but a little bit more fun.
